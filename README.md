# sword-and-scale-filter

A GCP Cloud Function that filters out all the Sword & Scale episodes that I don't care about.

1. After getting into a virtualenv with the projects dependencies (managed by poetry), deploy the
   function from the root directory of this project:

   ```shell
   make deploy
   ```
